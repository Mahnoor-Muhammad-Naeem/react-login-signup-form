## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors while running `npm start`, try the following steps:

1. Remove `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

*(On Windows Command Prompt / PowerShell, use `rmdir /s /q node_modules` or delete the folder via File Explorer.)*

2. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed and available in your PATH:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

3. Restart your terminal or code editor if commands don’t respond.

4. If you see port conflicts, make sure nothing else is running on port `3000` or change the port before starting the app.
